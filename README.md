# A-new-world
A beginner in the world of coding with strong passion to learn and start creating. A dream come to past
I am a graduate of Industial mathematics but from a nation that never saw any affiliation with mathematics and programming. I out of frustration delved into a career in customer service and later sales and marketing.
I was not fulfilled and hence started learning coding online after i was unable to get an institution to admit me into such field. 
I am currently on w3schools, freecodecamp, codecademy training and the xperience has been awesome.
today i learnt that i need to build my Github profile from a video i watched and knowing that delayed obedience is a disobedience, i decided to do this now.
I want to become one of the best progammers in Nigeria in few years to come. 
i know and i am positive that i have found what will make me what i was designed to be.
